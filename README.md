# Flicker

WIP Spacebar compatible (themed as comfy lavender) client that also works with Oldcord instances.

## Implemented Features

- Creating/joining guilds <br>
- Creating/fetching messages/WIP attachment media <br>
- Fetching member lists <br>
- Basic right click server context menu ( Leave Server / Delete Server )

## Setup

Run npm install and npm start. Works well with node 24.

## HELP WANTED

Help is actively wanted to implement more features into the client & clean/organize existing files. <br>
The end goal for Flicker is to be a suitable daily driver which is essentially bulletproof to takedowns (custom designed icons, and free-to-use fonts for commercial and non commerical purposes, etc)
