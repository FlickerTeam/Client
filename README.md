# Flicker

WIP Spacebar compatible (themed as comfy lavender) client that also works with Oldcord instances.

## Implemented Features

- Creating/joining guilds
- Creating/fetching messages/WIP attachment media
- Fetching member lists
- Basic right click server context menu ( Leave Server / Delete Server )

## Setup

Run npm install and npm start.

Works well with the latest LTS version of Node (Node 24), for ideal security practice, we aim for latest LTS compatibility.

## HELP WANTED

Help is actively wanted to implement more features into the client & clean/organize existing files.

The end goal for Flicker is to be a suitable daily driver which is essentially bulletproof to takedowns (custom designed/open-licensed icons, and free-to-use fonts for commercial and non commerical purposes, etc).
