# HELP WANTED
Help is actively wanted to implement more features into the client & clean/organize existing files.  <br>
The end goal for Flicker is to be a suitable daily driver which is essentially bulletproof to takedowns (custom designed icons, and free-to-use fonts for commercial and non commerical purposes, etc)
